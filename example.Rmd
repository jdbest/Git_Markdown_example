# Introduction

This is a simple example of using R Markdown documents to create APA-formatted documents with LaTeX compiling them into PDFs. You will need to install a version of LaTeX to compile; some suggestions are included [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/install-latex.html), but if they do not work, you may want to install [MacTeX](http://tug.org/mactex/) for Macs or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) for PCs. Of course, the Rmd document can also be compiled (knit) as an HTML file if you do not want to install a TeX distribution, but it will not follow APA style.

You will have to compile your references in a bibliography. Most folks recommend using Zotero, as do I; you'll need to output your references to a .bib file. Document/article titles will follow the capitalization you've got---use APA style yourself! (The most recent versions of R Markdown can also [help add your references](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html), including just from a DOI link.)

Some packages (e.g., {[papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja)}; [@austbarth2020]) will create APA-draft manuscripts, but may introduce extra details beyond the basic style. The style I lay out here will simply create a document using APA formatting of references. 

# Installation

You will need to download the `apa.csl` and `template.tex` documents into a directory where your Rmd file lives. Open (or create) your R Markdown document.

Your document will automatically include some YAML headers:

```
---
title: "Your title"
author: "Your name"
date: "3/29/2021"
output: pdf_document
---
```

You can keep the title and date, but you will need to update the others headers to include some of the following YAML headers in your R Markdown document. In particular, you must include the `doctype`, the full set of `output` parameters (`output: pdf_document: template: "template.tex"`), and the `bibliography` and `csl` lines. The others, including `shorttitle` and `leftheader`, `authors_note`, and so forth, are implemented in APA style documents.

You needn't write anything below the title of your references section---the bibliography will be automatically generated. If you notice that something is inappropriately not capitalized, make sure it is capitalized correctly in your .bib file; if it is, consider surrounding it with curly brackets to ensure
